= Receiver Module for WSP (Weather Station Plus)

NOTE: Will be updated to be more dynamic, from the original C implementation.

WARNING: This won't really do too much without the main weather station code.

This is the code for the receiver module which communicates with the raspberry pi via i2c and
controls the 433 Mhz receiver.
